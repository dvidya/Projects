Letter to Self
==============


Vidya, 


	It is perfectly OK to be stuck. This is not the end of the road. The road has puddles, speed breaks too. 
	With lots of patients and calm mindset, give a thought bit by bit. 
	Search knowledge database, share your difficulties with experts and seek help.
	Remind yourself why you are doing this.

	Just do it!

	My goals:
		Having decade experience on Enterprise Application Integration and Service Management, I wish to develop mobile service applications by learning and devloping web/mobile-apps. To begin with, wish to work as freelancer and gain hands on experience by developing various applications.
