				<p>Giraffes have a great effect on the trees that they feed on, delaying the growth of young trees for some years and giving “waistlines” to trees that are too tall. Feeding is at its highest during the first and last hours of daytime. Between these hours, giraffes mostly stand and ruminate.</p>

				<p>The giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis) is an African even-toed ungulate mammal, the tallest living terrestrial animal and the largest ruminant. Its chief distinguishing characteristics are its extremely long neck and legs, its horn-likeossicones and its distinctive coat patterns. The nine subspecies are distinguished by their coat patterns.</p>
